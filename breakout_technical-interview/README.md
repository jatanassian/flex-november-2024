### To Do

- [ ] Approaching Whiteboard Questions
- [ ] Examples

### Approaching Whiteboard Questions

- Physical whiteboard, paper, Google Jamboard, Word document...
- Not necessarily looking for 100% syntax accuracy

### Mindset during the problem solving

- Most important part is the logical steps
  - How should we solve this?
  - Is there a built-in method that would help here?
  - If statement?
  - For loop? What kind of loop?
- Take your time, breathe, think...
- **READ** the prompt, understand what it is asking
  - Consider doing this aloud
- Ask questions!
- Speak through your solution

### Problem solving

1. Input(s) - What is the input? Where does it come from?
2. Output(s) - What is the end result/value?
3. Processing - How do we get from input to output?

- Break things down into major steps
- Break down those major steps into smaller steps
- Keep breaking down steps until you can't anymore
